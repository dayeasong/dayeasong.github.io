My research focuses on unraveling the complexities of brain development in autism and its developmental trajectories through the integration of genetic, neuroimaging, and behavioral data. I am also dedicated to exploring the interplay between mental and physical health to enhance well-being in individuals and families affected by neurodevelopmental disorders.
